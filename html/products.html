When we got to the location it was hard to believe what we were seeing, it was incredible and insanely gorgeous. This shoot was anything but easy though. The sand gets everywhere and will ground the drone if it comes in contact with it, becuase of this all the footage was from one pack which is why I like calling this shoot a one pack wonder.<a href="https://youtu.be/yqw9dG4KJ1A" target="_blank">See the video!</a></p></div>

It was the most high speed car chasing I have done to date which was a fun challenge and makes for an amazing video. In addition this video shoot was right on the edge of a storm. Pretty quick after we packed everything back in the truck the rain and lightning started. You can notice the heavy rain in the background of a lot of the shots.</p></div>

This shoot was also the first weekend I had the 5inch drone. Before this I had only chased cars with a smaller 4inch without a camera. You can tell the video is a little rough on the edges but it is still one of my favorite shoots and shows the growth that I have undergone since starting to film FPV video.</p></div>

The colors mixed with the darker colors of the sky and the car make it look really cool. Utah valley is an area I drag on for being boring all the time but this is one of the most interesting videos. The tight canyon roads also posed an additional challenge which was super fun to work with and pushed me to get within inches of the car in some of the videos.</p></div>
